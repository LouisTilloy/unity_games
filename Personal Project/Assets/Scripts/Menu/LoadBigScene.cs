//This script lets you load a Scene asynchronously. It uses an asyncOperation to calculate the progress and outputs the current progress to Text (could also be used to make progress bars).

//Attach this script to a GameObject
//Create a Button (Create>UI>Button) and a Text GameObject (Create>UI>Text) and attach them both to the Inspector of your GameObject
//In Play Mode, press your Button to load the Scene, and the Text changes depending on progress. Press the space key to activate the Scene.
//Note: The progress may look like it goes straight to 100% if your Scene doesn’t have a lot to load.
